   <p> Michael Jordan (born February 17, 1963, Brooklyn, New York, U.S.) is a 
    former collegiate and professional basketball player widely considered 
    to be one of the greatest all-around players in the history of the game. 
    Jordan’s unmatched athleticism and competitive drive revolutionized
     the sport while winning six NBA championships with 
     the Chicago Bulls (1991–93, 1996–98).</p>

   <div class="education">
 <h2>Education</h2>
<p>Jordan grew up in Wilmington, North Carolina, and entered the University
of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1981. As a freshman, he made the winning
basket against Georgetown in the 1982 national championship game.
Jordan was named College Player of the Year in both his sophomore and
junior years, leaving North Carolina after his junior year.
He led the U.S. basketball team to Olympic gold medals in 1984 
in Los Angeles and in 1992 in Barcelona, Spain. The players who 
 competed in the latter Games became known as the Dream Team.</p>

    <h2>NBA</h2>
    <p>In 1984 Jordan, a guard standing 6 feet 6 inches (1.98 meters), was drafted 
    by the Chicago Bulls. He quickly became known as an exceptionally talented 
    shooter and passer and a tenacious defender. In his first season (1984–85), 
    he led the league in scoring and was named Rookie of the Year; after missing 
    most of the following season with a broken foot, he returned to lead the NBA 
    in scoring for seven consecutive seasons, averaging about 33 points per game. 
    He was only the second player (after Wilt Chamberlain) to score 3,000 points 
    in a single season (1986–87). Jordan was named the NBA’s Most Valuable Player 
    (MVP) five times (1988, 1991, 1992, 1996, 1998) and was also named Defensive 
    Player of the Year in 1988. In October 1993, after leading the Bulls to 
    their third consecutive championship, Jordan retired briefly and pursued 
    a career in professional baseball. He returned to basketball in March 1995. 
    In the 1995–96 season Jordan led the Bulls to a 72–10 regular season record, 
    the best in the history of the NBA (broken in 2015–16 by the Golden State 
    Warriors). From 1996 to 1998 the Jordan-led Bulls again won three 
    championships in a row, and each time Jordan was named MVP of the NBA finals. 
    After the 1997–98 season Jordan retired again.</p>
