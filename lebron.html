    <h1>The-king</h1>
   <p>LeBron James (born December 30, 1984, Akron, Ohio, U.S.) is an American professional 
    basketball player who is widely considered one of the greatest all-around
     players of all time and who won National Basketball Association (NBA) 
     championships with the Miami Heat (2012 and 2013), 
     the Cleveland Cavaliers (2016), and the Los Angeles Lakers (2020).
      In 2023 he became the NBA’s all-time leading scorer, breaking the record 
      (38,387) previously held by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.
       His dominance continued when in 2024, he recorded his 40,000 point scored. 
    A locally known basketball prodigy since elementary school,
     James was named Ohio’s Mr. Basketball (high-school player of the year)
      three times while leading Akron’s St. Vincent–St. Mary High School to 
      three Ohio state championships in his four years on the team.
      He became a national media sensation in his junior year after
       appearing on the cover of Sports Illustrated, where he was billed 
     by the magazine as “The Chosen One.” James was the consensus national 
     high-school player of the year in his senior season,
     and he was selected by the Cleveland Cavaliers with the first overall
    selection of the 2003 NBA draft. Additionally, he signed an
     unprecedented $90 million endorsement contract with the Nike shoe
      company before he ever played a professional game.</p>

 <h2>Basketball-career</h2>
<p>LeBron burst onto the scene as the first overall pick in the 2003 NBA Draft. His initial stint with the Cavs showcased his scoring ability, 
  court vision, and unmatched athleticism. He carried the team to their first-ever NBA Finals appearance in 2007, but
   they fell short against the San Antonio Spurs. In 2010, he made “The Decision” to join the Miami Heat, leaving behind a city that revered him.
  Miami Heat (2010-2014): LeBron teamed up with Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh in South Beach, forming the “Big Three.” 
  The Heat dominated the league, reaching four consecutive NBA Finals and winning two championships (2012, 2013). LeBron’s versatility 
  and clutch performances solidified his status as one of the game’s greats.
  Return to Cleveland (2014-2018): In a heartfelt homecoming, LeBron returned to Cleveland in 2014. His mission: deliver a championship to a city 
  starving for success. In 2016, he achieved the impossible, leading the Cavs back from a 3-1 deficit against the Golden State Warriors to win the NBA 
  title. His iconic block on Andre Iguodala remains etched in basketball lore.
  Los Angeles Lakers (2018-2024): LeBron donned the purple and gold, aiming to restore the Lakers’ glory. Despite injuries and roster challenges, 
  he guided them to the NBA championship in 2020, tying him with Kobe Bryant. His impact extended beyond the court, mentoring young talents like 
  Anthony Davis. As his career wound down, he became the NBA’s all-time leading scorer, etching his name in the annals of basketball history.
  LeBron’s legacy transcends stats; it’s about inspiring generations, elevating teammates, and leaving an indelible mark on the game. </p>
