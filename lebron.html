    <h1>The-king</h1>
   <p>LeBron James (born December 30, 1984, Akron, Ohio, U.S.) is an American professional 
    basketball player who is widely considered one of the greatest all-around
     players of all time and who won National Basketball Association (NBA) 
     championships with the Miami Heat (2012 and 2013), 
     the Cleveland Cavaliers (2016), and the Los Angeles Lakers (2020).
      In 2023 he became the NBA’s all-time leading scorer, breaking the record 
      (38,387) previously held by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.
       His dominance continued when in 2024, he recorded his 40,000 point scored. 
    A locally known basketball prodigy since elementary school,
     James was named Ohio’s Mr. Basketball (high-school player of the year)
      three times while leading Akron’s St. Vincent–St. Mary High School to 
      three Ohio state championships in his four years on the team.
      He became a national media sensation in his junior year after
       appearing on the cover of Sports Illustrated, where he was billed 
     by the magazine as “The Chosen One.” James was the consensus national 
     high-school player of the year in his senior season,
     and he was selected by the Cleveland Cavaliers with the first overall
    selection of the 2003 NBA draft. Additionally, he signed an
     unprecedented $90 million endorsement contract with the Nike shoe
      company before he ever played a professional game.</p>

<p>On July 24, 2023, at approximately 9:26 a.m. PDT, James collapsed at the Galen
     Center during a USC practice session. It was later revealed that he had 
     suffered cardiac arrest caused by a congenital heart defect.James 
     was released from the hospital on July 27. James was projected as a top 
     ten pick in the 2024 NBA draft and according to Jonathan Givony, was seen 
     as the most improved prospect in the country before his cardiac arrest.
    Less than five months removed from his cardiac arrest, James made his 
    collegiate debut for the Trojans on December 10, finishing with four points,
     three rebounds, two assists, two steals, and one block off the bench.
     On December 30, James scored a career-high 15 points on 6-of-11 from the
      field and had three assists in a road loss against Oregon State.
      On January 17, 2024, James played a season-high 30 minutes and recorded 
      11 points, five rebounds and six assists in an 82–67 loss to No. 12 Arizona.
     James appeared in USC’s final 25 games, starting six and averaging 4.8 
      points, 2.8 rebounds and 2.1 assists in 19.3 minutes.
    On April 5, 2024, James announced on Instagram that he would enter the 2024 
    NBA draft while maintaining his college eligibility and also enter the 
    transfer portal. In early May 2024, James was medically cleared to be 
    eligible for the NBA draft. On May 28, 2024, it was reported that 
    James had at least 10 workout invites from NBA teams but only visited a 
    "couple" of those teams, which included the Lakers and Suns</p>
